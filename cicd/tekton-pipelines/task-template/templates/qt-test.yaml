    description: |
      A .ssh directory with private key, known_hosts, config, etc. Copied to
      the user's home before git commands are executed. Used to authenticate
      with the git remote when performing the clone. Binding a Secret to this
      Workspace is strongly recommended over other volume types.
  - name: basic-auth
    optional: true
    description: |
      A Workspace containing a .gitconfig and .git-credentials file. These
      will be copied to the user's home before any git commands are run. Any
      other files in this Workspace are ignored. It is strongly recommended
      to use ssh-directory over basic-auth whenever possible and to bind a
      Secret to this Workspace over other volume types.
